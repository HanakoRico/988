  <h1>1-800</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Top - Owners / Founders (There may only be 3 owners at any point)</h2>
      <p>If you founded or currently own the group you are at the top.</p>
      <p>Examples Founders: Kyle & Noah | Owners: Hanako, Lost & Nullify</p>
      <p>To become an owner you have to provide extreme help while being a member, or you can show extreme dedication and potential and get chosen that way to be a future or current owner of 1-800. Will have ¹⁻⁸⁰⁰ at the end of their name.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Middle - Members (5 allowed at any given time MAX.)</h2>
      <p>To become a member you must have been chosen at either the start of Hanako's 1-800 or you showed great potential as a representative.</p>
      <p>Members are not as responsible for owners as they will not be made to make public service announcements like owners will be at any given time as a direct cause of controversy, but they will have a higher standard of expectations than representatives do over the look of 1-800. Will have ¹⁻⁸⁰⁰ at the end of their name.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Bottom - Representatives (Only 10 max at any given time)</h2>
      <p>You will be needed to help some but not to the extent of members.</p>
      <p>As a representative, you will potentially have to do undercover work for 1-800 as the members and owners will be publicly known to a far higher extent than representatives would be. If you are found to be against the group's methods/reasons, you will be removed.</p>
